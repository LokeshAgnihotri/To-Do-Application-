# Todo List

This is an introductory project from school where we learn the fundamentals of angular. The module focuses on front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) development. We will study state-of-the-art approaches of front-end web development. During this course groupe members will build a front-end of a web application using a JavaScript framework called Angular.

This project will be done in 7 weeks. in additions the carry out by three members namely Lokesk, Obaid and Huy.
